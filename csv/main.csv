Man, I feel just like a rockstar

And they always be smokin' like a Rasta
Fuckin' with me, call up on a Uzi
And show up, man them the shottas
When my homies pull up on your block
They make that thing go grrra-ta-ta-ta (pow, pow, pow)

Ay, act a fool on stage
Prolly leave my fuckin' show in a cop car
Ay, shit was legendary
Threw a TV out the window of the Montage

Cocaine on the table, liquor pourin', don't give a damn
Dude, your girlfriend is a groupie, she just tryna get in
Sayin', ""I'm with the band""

Seeing light in the dark, yeah, these things
And when you stare at your reflection
Finding hope in who it is
I know that you'll thank God you did

I know where you been, where you are, where you going
I know you're the reason I believe in life
What's the day without a little night?
I'm just tryna shed a little light
It can be hard
It can be so hard

You got everything to give right now

But I'm moving 'til my legs give out

Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me

'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight

Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own

We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect
I don't deserve this

Take my hand, stop, put van the man on the jukebox

We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate

We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play
And I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me

Bitching and moaning on and on 'bout the time I had
And by Tuesday, you could say that girl was good as gone
Then when Thursday came around, I was all alone

So I went for a drive to clear my mind, ended up at a Shell on I-65

Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch off ticket
Bought two twelve packs and a tank of gas with it
She swore they were a waist of time, oh, but she was wrong
I was caller number 5 on a radio station, won a 4-day, 3-night, beach vacation
Deep sea, senorita, fishing down in Panama
And I ain't gotta see my ex future mother-in-law anymore
Oh lord, when it rains it pours
When it rains it pours

Now she was sure real quick to up and apologize
When she heard about my new found luck on that FM dial
And it's crazy how this now just seems to come in when
What I thought was gonna be the death of me was my saving grace

It's got me thinking that her leaving is the only logical reason

That I got the last spot in the Hooter's parking lot
And the waitress left her number on my check with a heart
She picked up on the first ring when I gave her a call
And I only spent five bucks at the Moose Club Raffle
Won a used four-wheeler and three free passes
For me and two of my buddies to play a round of golf
And I ain't gotta see my ex future mother-in-law anymore
Oh lord, when it rains it pours

I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
Too short to keep following your homies
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more

I reminisce back to a time where niggas threw they hands
All of a sudden niggas pop a trunk and then we scram
Finger on trigger make a little nigga understand
What it's like to finally be the motherfuckin' man
Eyes wide that's from the power that the coward feels
Niggas die over bitches disrespecting dollar bills
Bloodshed that turned the city to a battlefield
I call it poison, you call it real (pop, pop, pop, pop)
That's how you feel?

Pistols be poppin' and niggas drop in a heartbeat
Scattered like roaches, a body laid on the concrete
Body laid on the concrete
Look, somebody laid on the concrete
No time for that, ain't no lookin' back, 'cause I'm running too
I made it home, I woke up and turned on the morning news
Overcame with a feeling I can't explain
'Cause that was my nigga James that was slain, he was 22
(Last night at around...) He was 22
(22 year old black male, suspect, poor...)

(I swear to God bruh)
We're gathered here today...
(I swear to God)
To mourn the life of James McMillan Jr
(I swear to God-nigga, I'mma kill them niggas man)
A tragedy, another tragedy in the black community
(I promise you bro...)
We got to do better, people
22 years old, this boy was too young
(I promise you bro, I'mma kill them niggas yo...)
Our condolences go to his family, our prayers
(I'mma kill them niggas myself...)
We know he's in a better place
We know he's in a better place

But I'm
Still missing you
And I can't
See the end of this
Just wanna feel your kiss
Against my lips
And now all this time
Is passing by
But I still can't seem to tell you why
It hurts me every time I see you
Realize how much I need you

I hate you I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

I miss you when I can't sleep
Or right after coffee
Or right when I can't eat
I miss you in my front seat
Still got sand in my sweaters
From nights we don't remember
Do you miss me like I miss you?
Fucked around and got attached to you
Friends can break your heart too, and
I'm always tired but never of you
If I pulled a you on you, you wouldn't like that shit
I put this reel out, but you wouldn't bite that shit
I type a text but then I nevermind that shit
I got these feelings but you never mind that shit
Oh oh, keep it on the low
You're still in love with me but your friends don't know
If you wanted me you would just say so
And if I were you, I would never let me go
I don't mean no harm
I just miss you on my arm
Wedding bells were just alarms
Caution tape around my heart
You ever wonder what we could have been?
You said you wouldn't and you fucking did
Lie to me, lie with me, get your fucking fix
Now all my drinks and all my feelings are all fucking mixed
Always missing people that I shouldn't be missing
Sometimes you gotta burn some bridges just to create some distance
I know that I control my thoughts and I should stop reminiscing
But I learned from my dad that it's good to have feelings
When love and trust are gone

You don't care you never did
You don't give a damn about me

How is it you never notice
That you are slowly killing me

(For your eyes, for your eyes)

Hey, niggas be dying on the daily
It seems my dreams faded for far too long
The consequences deadly
Can't visualize myself as nothing but a criminal
Control the block, serving up rocks and stay subliminal
'Cause young niggas is hardheaded, they letting off
Full of adrenaline, ignorant to what death can cause
Ain't no coming back, family dressed in black
Plus it's hot now, the cops outside, it's hard to flip a pack
And my daughter gotta eat, her mama be stressing me
Like I ain't the one who put them Jays on her feet
Like I ain't out in the field like that
I might be low for the moment but I will bounce back
Despite the charges, back to the wall, I fight regardless
Screaming, ""Fuck the law,"" my life is lawless
That's what you call it, ain't got to be no psychic
To see this is like the farthest thing from heaven
This is hell and I don't mean that hyperbolic
I try to find employment even if it's wiping toilets
But these felonies be making life the hardest
Resisting the temptation to run up and swipe a wallet
Or run up on your yard, snatch your daughter bike and pawn it
That's why I write this sonnet
If the pressure get too much for me to take and I break
Play this tape for my daughter and let her know my life is on it
(For your eyes) Let her know my life is on it
(For your eyes) For your eyes only

For your eyes, do you understand?

You probably grown now so this song'll hit you
If you're hearing this, unfortunately
Means that I'm no longer with you in the physical
Not even sure if I believe in God but because you still alive
He got me praying that the spiritual is real
So I can be a part of you still, my pops was killed too
So I know how part of you feels
Maybe you hate me, maybe you miss me, maybe you spite me
Life goes in cycles, maybe you'll date a nigga just like me
I hope not-I'm tired of dope spots
And fiends that smoke rocks
I've seen far too many niggas' hopes rot
I'm writing this because me and the devil had a dance
Now I see death around the corner, 'pologizing in advance
Don't know if I ever had a chance, at a glance, I'm a failure
Addicted to pushing paraphernalia
But Daddy had dreams once, my eyes had a gleam once
Innocence disappeared by the age of eight years
My Pops shot up-drug-related-mama addicted
So Granny raised me in projects where thugs was hanging
Blood was staining the concrete
Older niggas I loved talked like they was above
Maintaining a time sheet, that slow money
Picked up the family business
By the age of thirteen, six years later was handed sentence
'Round the same time is when you came in this world
Me and your mama thinking:
""What the fuck we naming this girl?""
I told her ""Nina"", the prettiest name that I could think of
For the prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen, I was nineteen
Took me two felonies to see the trap
This crooked ass system set for me
And now I fear it's too late for me to ever be
The one that set examples that was never set for me
I'm living fast, but not fast enough
'Cause karma keeps on catching up to me
And if my past becomes the death of me
I hope you understand-

For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?

It's several ways I could've went out, too many to count
Was it the trigger happy crackers that the badges give clout?
Was it the young niggas, blasting frustrated
'Cause the cash running out?
Niggas don't know how to act in a drought
See, baby girl, I realized
My definition of a real nigga was skewed
My views misshaped by new mixtapes
That confirmed the shit I learned in the streets was true
That real niggas don't speak when they beef with you
They just pull up on your street, let the heat achoo
And if a real nigga hungry, he gon' eat your food
I was a fool, spent all my time ducking school, ducking cops
Ducking rules, hugging blocks that don't love you
I pray you find a nigga with goals and point of views
Much broader than the corner, if not it's gon' corner you
Into a box, where your son don't even know his pops
And the cyclical nature of doing time continues
My worst fear is one day that you come home from school
And see your father face while hearing 'bout tragedy on news
I got the strangest feeling your daddy gonna lose his life soon
And sadly if you're listening now it must mean it's true
But maybe there's a chance that it's not
And this album remains locked
In a hard drive like valuable jewels
And I can teach you this in person
Like I'm teaching you to tie your own shoes
I love you and I hope to God I don't lose you

For your eyes, for your eyes only
For your eyes, for your eyes only
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes only-

One day your daddy called me, told me he had a funny feeling
What he'd been dealing with lately, he wasn't telling
I tried to pick his brains, still he wasn't revealing
But I could feel the sense of panic in his voice
And it was chilling, he said:
""Jermaine, I knew you since we was children
I never asked for nothing when times was hard
I never had discussions with you begging you to help me
I dealt with the repercussions of my actions
I know you tried to steer me 'way from that shit
But that shit was in my blood, you know my life
I know your Momma, nigga; send my love
In case I never get a chance to speak again
I won't forget the weekends spent sleeping at your crib
That's the way I wished my family lived
But my granny crib was in the 'jects-""
I had to interject like:
""Nigga what you talking 'bout? Fuck is you getting at?""
He said, ""Listen, I got no time to dive into descriptions
But I've been having premonitions
Just call it visions from the other side
I got a feeling I won't see tomorrow
Like the time I'm living on is borrowed
With that said, the only thing I'm proud to say, I was a father
Write my story down and if I pass
Go play it for my daughter when she ready""
And so I'm leaving you this record for your eyes only
Don't you ever scratch or disrespect it
This perspective is a real one, another lost 'Ville son
I dedicate these words to you and all the other children
Affected by the mass incarceration in this nation
That sent your pops to prison when he needed education
Sometimes I think this segregation would've done us better
Although I know that means that I would never
Be brought into this world 'cause my daddy was so thrilled
When he found him a white girl to take back to Jonesboro
With 'lil Zach and Cole World, barely one years old
Now it's thirty years later, making sure this story's told
Girl, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was cold
Not because he was the first
To get some pussy twelve years old
Not because he used to come through
In the Caddy on some vogues
Not because he went from bagging up
Them grams to serving O's
Nah, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was hard
Not because he lived a life of crime and sat behind some bars
Not because he screamed, ""Fuck the law"", although that was true

A practice of being present
There's no where I need to be
Except right here with you

With bananas and some almond milk

I got a Glock 40 and a little nine
Ready for the day a nigga pull mine

Just to make it through the job interviews

When the nights got cold, who stole you fire from down below?
You're looking at him, yo!

Oh, also I lasso'd the sun, you're welcome
To stretch your days and bring you fun
Also, I harnessed the breeze
You're welcome, to fill your sails and shake your trees

So what can I say except you're welcome?

There's no need to pray, it's okay, you're welcome
I guess it's just my way of being me

You're welcome, you're welcome
Well, come to think of it

Kid, honestly I can go on and on
I can explain every natural phenomenon
The tide, the grass, the ground
Oh, that was Maui just messing around
I killed an eel, I buried its guts
Sprouted a tree, now you've got coconuts
What's the lesson? What is the takeaway?
Don't mess with Maui when he's on the breakaway
And the tapestry here in my skin
Is a map of the victories I win
Look where I've been I make everything happen
Look at that mean mini Maui just tippity tappin'

Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, hey!

Well anyway, let me say you're welcome!
For the wonderful world you know
Hey, it's okay, it's okay you're welcome!

You're trying to be the best you can be but that's all you can do. If you don't give it all you got, you're only cheating yourself. Give it all you got, but if it ends up happening, it ends up happening.

That's what it's... that's what's happening with me.

I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn

I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya, gonna love ya, gonna love ya

Iggy Azalea:
This twisted cat and mouse game always starts the same
First we're both down to play, then somehow you go astray
We went from nothing to something, liking to loving
It was us against the world and now we're just fucking
It's like I loved you so much and now I just hate you
Feeling stupid for all the time that I gave you
I wanted all or nothing for us, ain't no place in between
B-by m-me believing what you say that you never mean
Like it'll last forever but now forever ain't as long
If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't be stuck singing this song
You were different from my last but now you got him mirrored
But as it all plays out I see it couldn't be clearer, now sing

Rita Ora (Iggy Azalea):
You used to be thirsty for me
But now you wanna be set free
This is the web, web that you weave
So baby now rest in peace

(It's all over with now)

I'm gonna love ya until you hate me (Right)
And I'm gonna show ya (Show 'em what? Show 'em what?) what's really crazy

I'm gonna l-l-l-love you until it hurts
Just to get you, I'm doing whatever works
You have never met nobody that'd do ya how I do ya
That will bring you to your knees, praise Jesus, hallelujah
I'ma make you beg for it, plead for it
Till you feel like you breathe for it
Till you do any and everything for it
I want you to fiend for it, wake up and dream for it
Till it's got you gasping for air and you leave for it
Till they have a cat scan on your mind and it's nothin' but me (on it, on it...)
Now it's me time believe that
If it's yours when you want it, I wouldn't promise I need that
Till I'm everywhere that you be at
I can't fall back, or quit it
'Cause this here's a fatal attraction so I take it all or I don't want shh

I'm hot, dog, catch up to me nigga

Aim for the stars and I shouldn't have missed

So Saturday baby we can get to freakin'""
